Community members have slammed a key initiative to reduce flight noise from planes at Brisbane Airport, claiming it has done little to address the issue, almost six months after being implemented.

In November 2024 Airservices Australia announced that SODPROPS would become Brisbane Airport’s “priority operating mode” when conditions allow, and planned to increase its usage from 2% to 5.3% of monthly flights in 2025.

SODPROPS, or Simultaneous Opposite Direction Parallel Runway Operations, refers to an operating mode where flights would simuluatiously land and take off over Moreton Bay, instead of over populated areas, in an effort to reduce flight noise.

However, analysis provided to this masthead by the Brisbane Flight Path Community Alliance (BFPCA) reveals the target is yet to be reached, with SODPROPS used for only 3.9% of flights in April this year.

Ross Stephens, who monitors SODPROPS usage for the BFPCA, said there has been “zero lived experience noise improvements” since Airservices Australia’s announcement.

“Positive impacts on noise reduction from SODPROPS usage has been overly ambitious as presented by [Airservices Australia and the government] when one considers the total number of flights arriving and departing Brisbane Airport,” Stephens said.

“Actually, 3.9% is an exception compared to the previous 5 months where only a 2% average was achieved for each month”

“It is doubtful that ASA will achieve anywhere near their stated target,” he said.

Stephens said the approximately 300 flights a month using SODPROPS have been “more than cancelled out” due to the increasing number of flights landing and departing at Brisbane Airport.

Airservices Australia did not respond to questions, but referred QUT News to a previous media release.

The media release, from November 2024, said the introduction of SODPROPS would reduce aircraft noise for between 300,000 to 500,000 residents.

Reports attribute the Greens’ promise to campaign for reductions in flight noise a key aspect of their 2022 success.

Outgoing Greens MP for Griffith Max Chandler-Mather said the Labor government refused to take action on this issue in the previous parliament.

“Until the federal government takes action to legislate a cap and curfew on flights, just like at Sydney Airport, residents won’t see a meaningful change to flight noise” Chandler-Mather said.

“SODPROPS is a first step, which was only secured due to advocacy by community groups and the Greens in parliament, but much more needs to be done.”

Federal infrastructure minister Catherine King, who ordered the change to SODPROPS last year, was not available for comment.
