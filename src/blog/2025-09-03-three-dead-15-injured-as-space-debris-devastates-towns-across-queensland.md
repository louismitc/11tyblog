Communities across Queensland are reeling after debris from a defunct satellite crashed into several regional centres on Friday, resulting in three deaths, 15 injuries, and millions of dollars in property and infrastructure damage.

Beginning in the late morning, cities and towns in coastal and central Queensland were hit by a barrage of small pieces of the space debris, described by one Hervey Bay resident as “a shooting star but way bigger and louder”.

Officials have already confirmed three deaths and 15 injuries caused by the falling debris, although this number may rise as search and rescue efforts continue.

As debris struck, residents from towns such as Dalby, Goondiwindi, Hervey Bay, Kingaroy, Maryborough, Millmerran and Wondai reported major damage to properties and infrastructure.

John Morris, a farmer from the rural border town of Goondiwindi, said he felt lucky his family escaped injury.

“I was just here at the mower shop with my grandchildren and all of a sudden there's a loud series of bangs in the sky, and bits started falling everywhere on buildings and cars,” Morris said.

Others weren’t so lucky. In Maryborough, a coastal city on the Fraser Coast, resident Jane Smith was in her living room when debris began to fall, leaving her roof destroyed and her husband hospitalised with serious injuries.

“It’s been a terrifying experience, but the support from our community has been incredible,” Smith said.

Speaking at a press conference in Maryborough, Queensland Emergency Services Minister Dan Purdie said the cost of damages was already estimated to be in the millions of dollars.

**Emergency services spring into action**

Officials and community leaders have praised the rapid response of emergency services, as a massive search and rescue effort continues.

Major hospitals, such as the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital, have activated emergency plans and stood up specialised teams to best respond to the disaster.

In Brisbane, patients from across the state requiring critical care touched down at Brisbane Airport’s new Aeromedical Hub, where they received continued emergency care while they awaited a transfer to hospital.

Dr. Ali Kitcatt, Queensland Retrieval Services medical director, said the Hub has been a massive asset in facilitating aeromedical transfers.

“It's really valuable to be able to have our coordination teams, our retrieval teams, rescue helicopters and planes all in the same place, and also to have a patient carefacility where we can provide ongoing emergency management while we're waiting for patient transfer to hospital,” Dr. Kitcatt said.

**Government support offered as residents urged to follow safety measures**

Residents in affected areas have been instructed to stay indoors until otherwise advised and to avoid approaching or touching fallen debris, which may be hazardous.

Queensland Emergency Services Minister Dan Purdie said the government is already deploying financial and logistical aid to affected areas, with the State Disaster Coordination Centre activated to oversee emergency operations.

Financial aid has been made available for residents in response to immediate accommodation, food and clothing needs, as well as emotional and psychological support services.

Evacuation centres have also been established across Queensland for displaced residents seeking shelter and support.

Officials did not provide details on how affected residents could access these supports before publication.

**Leaders vow to rebuild**

Despite facing significant hardship, community leaders have praised residents for their strength and solidarity in the wake of the disaster.

In a joint statement, the mayors of Goondiwindi, Millmerran, Dalby, Kingaroy, Wondai, Maryborough and Hervey Bay said they were coordinating their response with the state government and federal agencies, as well as liaising with space agencies to understand the cause of the incident and prevent future disasters.

The Millmerran mayor, Sarah Thompson, said the resilience of her community has been “inspiring”.

“We will continue to support each other and rebuild stronger than ever,” Thompson said.

“Our community has faced adversity before, and I am confident that we will come through this even more united.”
